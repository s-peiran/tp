### Project: NoteNote

NoteNote is a desktop note-taking application that allows users to efficiently record notes for their contacts. It provides tools for organizing and categorizing contacts in a systematic and easy-to-navigate structure. Users interact with it through a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.
